<p>We assume you will be replicating and executing the code you see in the videos while watching. This step is crucial for two reasons. 

  </p>



<p>First, this will help you solidify the knowledge acquired during the lecture. Second, the code executed during a lecture may act as a prerequisite for the subsequent exercise. Therefore, please do not skip this step!

  </p>



<p>However, should you need an exact copy of the code from all lessons, you can use the following *.sql file as a reference:

  </p>



<p><em>MySQL for Data Analytics and BI – Lecture Code.sql</em></p>



<p>Wherever applicable, the texts of the tasks and their corresponding solutions will be provided as articles that will be displayed right after the video lessons. Nevertheless, for your convenience, we have created an *.sql file containing the entire lecture code and the solutions of all tasks.

  </p>



<p><em>MySQL for Data Analytics and BI – Lecture Code and Tasks Solutions.sql</em></p>



<p>As usual, should you have any questions, please do not hesitate to post them in the Q&amp;A section of the course.

  </p>



<p>Thank you and good luck!
