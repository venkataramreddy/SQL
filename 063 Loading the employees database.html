<p>For this purpose, you’ll be using a huge dataset that can be found on GitHub. It is frequently used by programmers about to step it up a notch and dig deeper into SQL. This means this dataset is the best possible choice for laying the foundations of working with MySQL and relational databases. 

  </p>

<p>We will take advantage of its complexity by solving several challenging tasks. These tasks will be a wonderful exercise that will turn you into a proficient SQL user. 

  </p>

<p>We have re-organized the database script in an SQL file that you can download and run. Please, access the link available in the resources section of this lecture. 

  </p>

<p>Then, download the database file named “Employees”.

  </p>

<p>Once this process is ready, open the script file from Workbench as you would open other SQL files.

  </p>

<p>Run the code.
